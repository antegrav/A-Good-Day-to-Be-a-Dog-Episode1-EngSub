00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:49,518
Staying at home after work gets lonely. Right?

167
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:52,008
I'm not lonely.

168
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:56,118
Oh! Mr. Jin, you're more like the chic cat type, huh?

169
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:59,678
This is my baby. He looks like you, right?

170
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:02,338
This is your cat?

171
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:05,558
It's so pretty!

172
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,078
You must like cats, too.

173
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,208
Yes, I guess. But I like dogs more.

174
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:17,938
That's because dogs are just really kind. Right?

175
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:20,718
Like him.

176
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:24,298
Goochie goochie goo. You're so kind.

177
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:26,118
Don't you think?

178
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:29,938
One, two!

179
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:32,108
Whoa!

180
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,808
That was so cool!

181
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,218
Hold on.

182
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:38,738
I'm going to use the restroom.

183
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:41,508
- She's so cool!
- So cool!

184
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:44,418
Ms. Chae Ah is so cool!

185
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:51,038
<i>Daebak! Jun Woo sunbae's bride is Doo Na!</i>

187

[Friends, let's get together: Poor Hae Na. Are you okay?]

188
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:03,918
These jerks.

189
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,358
Ms. Hae Na, is something wrong?

190
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,068
It's nothing.

191
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:29,558
Mr. Bo Gyeom, you don't have a girlfriend, do you?

192
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:36,088
Do you think I do or not?

193
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:38,908
If I had a girlfriend, I'd be on a date right now.

194
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:43,018
I'm the type to go all-in on my girlfriend.

195
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:46,818
Then what's your ideal type?

196
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:49,578
I don't really have an ideal type.

197
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,568
But still. You must be attracted to something.

198
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:55,608
I just...

199
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:58,128
like someone who likes me.

200
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,618
I hate that pre-dating flirting phase.

201
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:04,678
I appreciate it when they tell me first, "I like you."

202
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,058
"Do you want to date me?"

203
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,078
- I'm going to get this call.
- Sure.

204
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:18,718
Hey, Seo Won! It's cold outside. Wear this.

205
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:23,468
He hates complicated things.

206
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:25,918
Just simply go!

207
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,548
Go?

208
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,208
Ms. Hae Na?

209
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:56,338
Guess what I like more than dogs.

210
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:02,268
It's you.

211
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,688
Really?

212
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:09,898
So...

213
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,188
tell me first.

214
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,248
Go.

215
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,448
Mr. Bo Gyeom.

Ms. Han!

218
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:10,948
Yes, it's me.

219
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,978
Are you okay? You seem really drunk.

220
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:19,058
No, no. I'm not drunk at all.

221
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:22,118
I came to tell you something.

222
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:26,898
You said so before. That you...

223
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:30,428
appreciate simple things.

224
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:37,308
Which is why you like women who like you. And that...

225
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,538
you'd like...

226
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:43,618
for them to be honest with you.

227
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:49,998
So what I want to tell you is...

228
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:59,038
I like you, Mr. Bo Gyeom.

229
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:10,708
<i>That's right.</i>

230
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,628
<i>If it's Mr. Bo Gyeom, he'll accept a woman like me, too.</i>

231
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,728
Ms. Hae Na.

232

<i>Whoa! Mr. Bo Gyeom can even talk while he kisses.</i>

233
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:09,638
Whoa!

234
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,548
Are you okay?

235
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:17,748
Mr. Jin, what are you doing here?

236
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,128
Sorry?

237
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:23,668

238
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:30,158
Why are you wearing this coat?

239
00:18:30,158 --> 00:18:31,758
Whoa!

00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,968
Oh, I'm sorry!

241

Hey! Your bag!

243

Where's Ms. Hae Na going?

244
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:48,448
Oh, well...

245
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:56,188
Her family must be strict. Something about a curfew?

246
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:59,378
Doesn't she live with just her older sister?

247

00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:08,198

<i>Because of that damned curse.</i>

251
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:37,968
Shit!

252
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:01,318
What do I do?

253
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,748
Hae Na, aren't I handsome today?

254
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:36,418
No.

255
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:39,358
- I'm more handsome than your dad, right?
- No.

256
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,148
You rascal.

257
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,348
I'll be back.

258
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:44,438

What's with this mutt?

263
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,728
It's not a mutt. It's my uncle.

264
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:05,358
His name is Uncle? Uncle, give me your paw.

265
00:21:06,518 --> 00:21:11,018
Don't touch my uncle. He's really my uncle.

266

No way. Stop bluffing.

267
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:19,438
She's not. Our mom said our family turns into dogs when we kiss someone.

268
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:22,618
Then you'll turn into a dog if you kiss someone, too?

269
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:23,878
Yeah.

For how long?

322

Of course not.

their appearance will turn into something that is not human.

They must be able to prove their outstanding love

So, you thought you came onto the sweet Korean history teacher,

That wasn't a kiss.

It was just a collision between lips.

No, no.

Just when I think he can't get more handsome, he becomes more handsome the next day!

Oh! How did you know?

444

It was impossible not to know in that situation.

445
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:53,218
So why were you wearing Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom's jacket?

446
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:54,878

There's no need to feel uncomfortable.

00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:36,368
Hey!

494
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:43,418
[Blue Crab King, Original]

495
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:48,018
Was she talking about crabs, not dogs*?
(Dogs and crabs sound similar in Korean.)

496
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:57,198
Easy.

497
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:09,558
What a good boy.

498
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:37,488
- Be gentle.
- It's okay, it's okay.

499
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,798
A little further in.

500
00:37:45,758 --> 00:37:47,378
Dong Cheol...

501
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:50,108
Let's go home together. Let's go to Noona's house, okay?

502
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:53,568
What should I do? I'm so sad...

503
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:55,508
It's okay.

504
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:12,188
BUN, creatinine... all kidney levels are bad.

505
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:14,958
I think a dialysis is needed,

506
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,898
but he's too old to get surgery for his head tumor.

507
00:38:17,898 --> 00:38:20,498
How much longer...

508
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,868
will Uncle be able to live?

509
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,808
Don't worry too much.

510
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:31,328
They do live six more months after getting told one month.

511
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:35,638
That's why you need to undo your curse quickly.

512
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:39,038
Didn't you see Mom crying her eyes out earlier?

513
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:45,918
Ask that guy out to dinner and make him drink alcohol until midnight.

514
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:50,218
When he's all drunk and confused, kiss him in your dog form, and that's it.

515
00:38:50,218 --> 00:38:52,608
Gosh. It's easier said than done.

516
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:55,718
Ask him out first, for now.

517
00:38:55,718 --> 00:38:58,158
We'll also come since you need to cover up if you fail.

518
00:38:58,158 --> 00:39:00,608
Yes, you do need to cover up.

519
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,098
"We"?

520
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:05,328
Woo Taek,

521
00:39:05,328 --> 00:39:07,358
you know what?

522
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,638
After my curse was undone and when I feel sad or disappointed,

523
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:13,428
I get this urge to bite.

524
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:15,978
Do you want to get bitten?

525
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,088
I-I got you.

526
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,908
I'm going inside first.

527
00:39:31,908 --> 00:39:33,708
Okay.

528
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,478
Good night.

529
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:57,088
Don't worry too much.

530
00:39:57,088 --> 00:39:59,008
She'll undo the curse soon.

531
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:01,458
Woo Taek.

532
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,568
You should...

533
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:06,718
do something with me.

534
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:10,348
Hey, did you discuss this with her?

535
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:14,198
Even if you're family, doesn't she have the right to privacy?

536
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,668
Go turn her face a little to the left.

537
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:19,988
Gosh, I'm sure she'll get mad.

538
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:23,478
This will be a good memory once her curse is undone.

539
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:26,278
Okay.

540
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:34,308
My!

541
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,078
Isn't Hae Na so cute? Look at this.

542
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:38,968
Even if you're family, this is- Whoa, she is cute, though.

543
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:40,548
Right, right?

544
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:47,445
I'm naturally terrible at flattering someone.

545
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,015
Hello.

546
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:54,975
What are you doing right now?

547
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:59,525
Oh, my! There was so much dust on your desk.

548
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:05,195
It's not good for your lungs, right? I was just worried about your health.

549
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:07,395
I'll take care of my health.

550
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:09,295
Of course, you should.

551
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:11,785
Are you eating properly, by the way?

552
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:15,975
Should I buy you some meat? Meat with a shot of soju.

553
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,915
Gosh, we really don't click.

554
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:37,415
I still need to try.

555
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:44,015
Don't you hear your dry hands screaming?

556
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:44,855
Sorry?

557
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:49,785
When it's dry, wouldn't your life be better with a glass of moist alcohol?

558
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:52,015
I don't like humidity.

559
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,575
You must hate the rainy season.

560
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:57,115
So, shall we make plans to prepare for the upcoming rainy season?

561
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,895
With some beef intestines and soju, yeah?

562
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:13,035
Class dismissed.

563
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:15,415
<i>Thank you!</i>

564
00:42:19,305 --> 00:42:21,025
The kids just don't listen, do they?

565
00:42:21,025 --> 00:42:24,435
When you're stressed, pig feet and soju are the best.

566
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:35,855
Gosh, you're picking at your food so much.

567
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:39,475
When you don't have an appetite, have chicken feet with soju.

568
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:50,755
Dang it!

569
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:04,975
Why are you in a bad mood this time?

570
00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:18,585
[Mr. Jin Seo Won]
<i>This evening works for me.</i>

571
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:21,645
My goodness.

572
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,795
<i>Operation launches this evening.</i>

573
00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:49,085
Whoa, finally.

574
00:43:55,305 --> 00:43:57,235
Mr. Song Woo Taek,

575
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,165
today's the day.

576
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:05,855
Excuse me, two bottles of soju for us, please.

577
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:08,585
Please give me the lukewarm ones, not the cold ones.

578
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:11,325
- I won't be drinking alcohol.
- Sorry?

579
00:44:11,325 --> 00:44:14,985
How can you not drink soju with spicy stir-fried chicken? That's the unwritten law.

580
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,155
- I still don't-
- Still,

581
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:21,555
you should abide by the unwritten law since it's still a law.

582
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,375
I'll just have a glass of beer, then.

583
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:29,125
Excuse me! Please give us a bottle of beer

584
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,345
in addition to the soju.

585
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:41,735
Beer tastes smoother when mixed.

586
00:44:41,735 --> 00:44:46,125
I know the killer ratio for somaek*. Should I show you one?
(Soju and beer.)

587
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,555
I'm fine.

588
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:50,645
I get drunk too quickly when I drink soju.

589
00:44:55,565 --> 00:44:56,695
I'll take this call.

590
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,845
Oh, okay! You can go ahead. Hurry!

591
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,635
<i>Get him totally plastered.</i>

592
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:08,285
So he won't even realize if it's a dream or not

593
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:10,765
when a dog he just kissed becomes human.

594
00:45:10,765 --> 00:45:12,555
You got it?

595
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,705
Even that bastard who said he loved me thousands of times

596
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:20,685
treated me like a monster when I became a dog in front of his eyes.

597
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:25,025
Worse off, you've got an awkward and uncomfortable coworker.

598
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:27,925
Make sure no one catches you.

599
00:45:35,195 --> 00:45:36,755
More, more, more.

600
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:39,585
More!

601
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,345
Cheers.

602
00:45:52,345 --> 00:45:54,265
Sure.

603
00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:28,955
I'm getting so drunk.

604
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:44,725
Gosh, why are we leaving this early when she turns at midnight?

605
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:46,625
You have nothing to do anyway.

606
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:49,295
Get a girlfriend or something if you don't want to do this.

607
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:53,855
Y-You think I can't get a girlfriend, huh?

608
00:47:01,315 --> 00:47:03,385
Well...

609
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:08,435
I kind of know why you insisted on wanting to see me tonight.

610
00:47:09,315 --> 00:47:10,985
Sorry?

611
00:47:10,985 --> 00:47:14,125
Since I'm close to Bo Gyeom,

612
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,365
you want me to connect you both, isn't it?

613
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:20,575
Oh, you're right. That's right. The connection.

614
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:26,695
But I don't know if I could help you because I'm very clumsy at this.

615
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:29,675
Come on, what's there to be clumsy about?

616
00:47:29,675 --> 00:47:32,335
You just need to be there in that place.

617
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:34,555
If you'll just stay there in your spot,

618
00:47:34,555 --> 00:47:38,755
I won't think twice and go to him with your help.

619
00:47:45,515 --> 00:47:47,295
By the way...

620
00:47:48,675 --> 00:47:50,795
why do you hate me, Mr. Jin?

621
00:47:50,795 --> 00:47:52,315
Why would I hate you, Ms. Han?

622
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:54,425
Exactly! Why do you hate me?

623
00:47:54,425 --> 00:47:56,985
What did I ever do to you?

624
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:58,335
But I never hated you.

625
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:00,645
Whoa! You make me laugh.

626
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:05,155
I've got an upset note in my heart, okay? I remember everything.

627
00:48:05,155 --> 00:48:07,515
<i>During fifth period's free period on April 20th, last year,</i>

628
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:10,765
<i>when the teachers chipped in to buy snacks.</i>

629
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:13,175
Whoa, gosh.

630
00:48:13,175 --> 00:48:15,815
We didn't buy soondae.

631
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:21,535
Whoa, you disappeared in a split second.

632
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:23,445
Did you use an invisible cape or something?

633
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:26,055
Do you remember or not?

634
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:26,935
I remember.

635
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:29,425
And also, on Ms. Song's birthday last year,

636
00:48:29,425 --> 00:48:31,885
<i>when we went to buy the cake together.</i>

637
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:34,195
They say the mango flavor tastes good,

638
00:48:34,195 --> 00:48:37,645
but Ms. Song likes matcha flavor.

639
00:48:41,355 --> 00:48:44,255
But that one looks tasty, too.

640
00:48:46,695 --> 00:48:48,605
What should we do?

641
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:50,845
Do you remember or not?

642
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:56,045
I remember.

643
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:57,575
See?

644
00:48:57,575 --> 00:48:59,135
I mean,

645
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,775
why on Earth do you hate me?

646
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:04,245
Why do you find me uncomfortable?

647
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:07,015
When I'm with you, it's really-

648
00:49:10,445 --> 00:49:11,995
I have my reasons.

649
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:15,005
So, tell me about those reasons.

650
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:28,495
Anyhow, it's true I avoided you because I was a bit uncomfortable,

651
00:49:28,495 --> 00:49:31,205
but it wasn't because I hate you.

652
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:33,415
I'm sorry if I made you misunderstand.

653
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:35,515
Wait, what's that supposed to...

654
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:37,025
And...
