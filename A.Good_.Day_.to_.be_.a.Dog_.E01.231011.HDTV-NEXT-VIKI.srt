166
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:49,518
Staying at home after work gets lonely. Right?

167
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:52,008
I'm not lonely.

168
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:56,118
Oh! Mr. Jin, you're more like the chic cat type, huh?

169
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:59,678
This is my baby. He looks like you, right?

170
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:02,338
This is your cat?

171
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:05,558
It's so pretty!

172
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,078
You must like cats, too.

173
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,208
Yes, I guess. But I like dogs more.

174
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:17,938
That's because dogs are just really kind. Right?

175
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:20,718
Like him.

176
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:24,298
Goochie goochie goo. You're so kind.

177
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:26,118
Don't you think?

178
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:29,938
One, two!

179
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:32,108
Whoa!

180
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,808
That was so cool!

181
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,218
Hold on.

182
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:38,738
I'm going to use the restroom.

183
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:41,508
- She's so cool!
- So cool!

184
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:44,418
Ms. Chae Ah is so cool!

185
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:51,038
<i>Daebak! Jun Woo sunbae's bride is Doo Na!</i>

186
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:58,698
<i>Your best friend is marrying your first love.</i>

187
00:12:58,698 --> 00:13:01,478
[Friends, let's get together: Poor Hae Na. Are you okay?]

188
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:03,918
These jerks.

189
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,358
Ms. Hae Na, is something wrong?

190
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:20,068
It's nothing.

191
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:29,558
Mr. Bo Gyeom, you don't have a girlfriend, do you?

192
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:36,088
Do you think I do or not?

193
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:38,908
If I had a girlfriend, I'd be on a date right now.

194
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:43,018
I'm the type to go all-in on my girlfriend.

195
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:46,818
Then what's your ideal type?

196
00:13:47,838 --> 00:13:49,578
I don't really have an ideal type.

197
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,568
But still. You must be attracted to something.

198
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:55,608
I just...

199
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:58,128
like someone who likes me.

200
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,618
I hate that pre-dating flirting phase.

201
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:04,678
I appreciate it when they tell me first, "I like you."

202
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,058
"Do you want to date me?"

203
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,078
- I'm going to get this call.
- Sure.

204
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:18,718
Hey, Seo Won! It's cold outside. Wear this.

205
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:23,468
He hates complicated things.

206
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:25,918
Just simply go!

207
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,548
Go?

208
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:46,208
Ms. Hae Na?

209
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:56,338
Guess what I like more than dogs.

210
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:02,268
It's you.

211
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:07,688
Really?

212
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:09,898
So...

213
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,188
tell me first.

214
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,248
Go.

215
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,448
Mr. Bo Gyeom.

216
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:03,798
Mr. Lee.

217
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:07,858
Ms. Han!

218
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:10,948
Yes, it's me.

219
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,978
Are you okay? You seem really drunk.

220
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:19,058
No, no. I'm not drunk at all.

221
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:22,118
I came to tell you something.

222
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:26,898
You said so before. That you...

223
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:30,428
appreciate simple things.

224
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:37,308
Which is why you like women who like you. And that...

225
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,538
you'd like...

226
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:43,618
for them to be honest with you.

227
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:49,998
So what I want to tell you is...

228
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:59,038
I like you, Mr. Bo Gyeom.

229
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:10,708
<i>That's right.</i>

230
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,628
<i>If it's Mr. Bo Gyeom, he'll accept a woman like me, too.</i>

231
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,728
Ms. Hae Na.

232
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:03,948
<i>Whoa! Mr. Bo Gyeom can even talk while he kisses.</i>

233
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:09,638
Whoa!

234
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,548
Are you okay?

235
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:17,748
Mr. Jin, what are you doing here?

236
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,128
Sorry?

237
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:23,668
Your lips...

238
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:30,158
Why are you wearing this coat?

239
00:18:30,158 --> 00:18:31,758
Whoa!

240
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,968
Oh, I'm sorry!

241
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:42,128
Ms. Han. Ms. Han! Ms. Hae Na!

242
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,298
Hey! Your bag!

243
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:46,738
Where's Ms. Hae Na going?

244
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:48,448
Oh, well...

245
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:56,188
Her family must be strict. Something about a curfew?

246
00:18:56,188 --> 00:18:59,378
Doesn't she live with just her older sister?

247
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:02,858
<i>I only have one minute left.</i>

248
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:05,138
<i>If I kiss a man,</i>

249
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:08,198
<i>I turn into a dog.</i>

250
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,748
<i>Because of that damned curse.</i>

251
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:37,968
Shit!

252
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:01,318
What do I do?

253
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,748
Hae Na, aren't I handsome today?

254
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:36,418
No.

255
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:39,358
- I'm more handsome than your dad, right?
- No.

256
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,148
You rascal.

257
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,348
I'll be back.

258
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:44,438
Okay, see you later.

259
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:47,528
<i>My uncle was fine when he left in the morning...</i>

260
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:50,778
Uncle! I got 100!

261
00:20:52,848 --> 00:20:54,788
<i>returned as a dog.</i>

262
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:57,048
What's with this mutt?

263
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:00,728
It's not a mutt. It's my uncle.

264
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:05,358
His name is Uncle? Uncle, give me your paw.

265
00:21:06,518 --> 00:21:11,018
Don't touch my uncle. He's really my uncle.

266
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:13,698
No way. Stop bluffing.

267
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:19,438
She's not. Our mom said our family turns into dogs when we kiss someone.

268
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:22,618
Then you'll turn into a dog if you kiss someone, too?

269
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:23,878
Yeah.

270
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:27,768
I'll believe you if you show me.

271
00:21:34,988 --> 00:21:36,958
What the heck?

272
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,448
You haven't changed!

273
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:42,098
I'll change after one minute.

274
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,478
Mom! It's not working!

275
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:00,758
What's not working?

276
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:02,768
I kissed him, but I haven't changed!

277
00:22:02,768 --> 00:22:04,188
What?

278
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:19,698

Zero...

Seven...

300
00:23:48,228 --> 00:23:49,868
Han Yoo Na?

301
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:54,458
You just left like that last time. And now...

302
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,918
Who was it this time?

303
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:58,618
Which bastard did you kiss this time, Han Yoo Na?

304
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:01,418
- What about me?
- Geez, you scared me!

305
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:03,688
You...

306
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:06,958
y-you're not...

307
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,918
Who's this?

308
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:15,068
This is Hae Na's shoe.

309
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:21,738
You're Han Hae Na?

310
00:24:27,818 --> 00:24:30,018
Han Hae Na, what will you do?

311
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:33,628
- What will you do?
- What's going on?

312
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:37,748
What the hell? What happened?

313
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:38,828
What is she saying?

314
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:42,468
She has to talk, so I understand! She's barking right now.

315
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:45,298
<i>What do I do now? What do I do?</i>

316
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:48,578
All right, so be quiet!

317
00:24:57,548 --> 00:25:00,688
She'll be naked when she wakes up tomorrow.

318
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:03,798
When will she turn back into a human?

319
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:05,898
Six in the morning.

320
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:09,218
And she'll turn into a dog again at midnight.

321
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:10,598
For how long?

322
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:12,538
For 100 days.

323
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:16,808
If she can't undo the curse by then, she'll live the rest of her life as a dog.

324
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,928
Like your uncle?

325
00:25:21,748 --> 00:25:24,368
She's still able to sleep in her situation?

326
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:26,808
You've never turned into a dog, have you?

327
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:28,288
Of course not.

328
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:30,528
It's exhausting.

329

You're a tenth of your normal size, but the world is the same.

If your children have a lover and they kiss,

337
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:28,118
their appearance will turn into something that is not human.

338
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:31,578
They must be able to prove their outstanding love

339

in order to change back into a human.

- I'm scared.

So, you thought you came onto the sweet Korean history teacher,

That wasn't a kiss.

It was just a collision between lips.

No, no.

Just when I think he can't get more handsome, he becomes more handsome the next day!

Oh! How did you know?

444

It was impossible not to know in that situation.

445
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:53,218
So why were you wearing Mr. Lee Bo Gyeom's jacket?

446
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:54,878

There's no need to feel uncomfortable.

00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:34,978
Hey-

493
00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:36,368
Hey!

494
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:43,418
[Blue Crab King, Original]

495
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:48,018
Was she talking about crabs, not dogs*?
(Dogs and crabs sound similar in Korean.)

496
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:57,198
Easy.

497
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:09,558
What a good boy.

498
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:37,488
- Be gentle.
- It's okay, it's okay.

499
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,798
A little further in.

500
00:37:45,758 --> 00:37:47,378
Dong Cheol...

501
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:50,108
Let's go home together. Let's go to Noona's house, okay?

502
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:53,568
What should I do? I'm so sad...

503
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:55,508
It's okay.

504
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:12,188
BUN, creatinine... all kidney levels are bad.

505
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:14,958
I think a dialysis is needed,

506
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,898
but he's too old to get surgery for his head tumor.

507
00:38:17,898 --> 00:38:20,498
How much longer...

508
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,868
will Uncle be able to live?

509
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,808
Don't worry too much.

510
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:31,328
They do live six more months after getting told one month.

511
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:35,638
That's why you need to undo your curse quickly.

512
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:39,038
Didn't you see Mom crying her eyes out earlier?

513
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:45,918
Ask that guy out to dinner and make him drink alcohol until midnight.

514
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:50,218
When he's all drunk and confused, kiss him in your dog form, and that's it.

515
00:38:50,218 --> 00:38:52,608
Gosh. It's easier said than done.

516
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:55,718
Ask him out first, for now.

517
00:38:55,718 --> 00:38:58,158
We'll also come since you need to cover up if you fail.

518
00:38:58,158 --> 00:39:00,608
Yes, you do need to cover up.

519
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,098
"We"?

520
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:05,328
Woo Taek,

521
00:39:05,328 --> 00:39:07,358
you know what?

522
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,638
After my curse was undone and when I feel sad or disappointed,

523
00:39:10,638 --> 00:39:13,428
I get this urge to bite.

524
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:15,978
Do you want to get bitten?

525
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,088
I-I got you.

526
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,908
I'm going inside first.

527
00:39:31,908 --> 00:39:33,708
Okay.

528
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,478
Good night.

529
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:57,088
Don't worry too much.

530
00:39:57,088 --> 00:39:59,008
She'll undo the curse soon.

531
00:39:59,008 --> 00:40:01,458
Woo Taek.

532
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,568
You should...

533
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:06,718
do something with me.

534
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:10,348
Hey, did you discuss this with her?

535
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:14,198
Even if you're family, doesn't she have the right to privacy?

536
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,668
Go turn her face a little to the left.

537
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:19,988
Gosh, I'm sure she'll get mad.

538
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:23,478
This will be a good memory once her curse is undone.

539
00:40:24,478 --> 00:40:26,278
Okay.

540
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:34,308
My!

541
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,078
Isn't Hae Na so cute? Look at this.

542
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:38,968
Even if you're family, this is- Whoa, she is cute, though.

543
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:40,548
Right, right?

544
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:47,445
I'm naturally terrible at flattering someone.

545
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,015
Hello.

546
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:54,975
What are you doing right now?

547
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:59,525
Oh, my! There was so much dust on your desk.

548
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:05,195
It's not good for your lungs, right? I was just worried about your health.

549
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:07,395
I'll take care of my health.

550
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:09,295
Of course, you should.

551
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:11,785
Are you eating properly, by the way?

552
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:15,975
Should I buy you some meat? Meat with a shot of soju.

553
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,915
Gosh, we really don't click.

554
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:37,415
I still need to try.

555
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:44,015
Don't you hear your dry hands screaming?

556
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:44,855
Sorry?

557
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:49,785
When it's dry, wouldn't your life be better with a glass of moist alcohol?

558
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:52,015
I don't like humidity.

559
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:53,575
You must hate the rainy season.

560
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:57,115
So, shall we make plans to prepare for the upcoming rainy season?

561
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,895
With some beef intestines and soju, yeah?

562
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:13,035
Class dismissed.

563
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:15,415
<i>Thank you!</i>

564
00:42:19,305 --> 00:42:21,025
The kids just don't listen, do they?

565
00:42:21,025 --> 00:42:24,435
When you're stressed, pig feet and soju are the best.

566
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:35,855
Gosh, you're picking at your food so much.

567
00:42:35,855 --> 00:42:39,475
When you don't have an appetite, have chicken feet with soju.

568
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:50,755
Dang it!

569
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:04,975
Why are you in a bad mood this time?

570
00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:18,585
[Mr. Jin Seo Won]
<i>This evening works for me.</i>

571
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:21,645
My goodness.

572
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,795
<i>Operation launches this evening.</i>

573
00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:49,085
Whoa, finally.

574
00:43:55,305 --> 00:43:57,235
Mr. Song Woo Taek,

575
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,165
today's the day.

576
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:05,855
Excuse me, two bottles of soju for us, please.

577
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:08,585
Please give me the lukewarm ones, not the cold ones.

578
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:11,325
- I won't be drinking alcohol.
- Sorry?

579
00:44:11,325 --> 00:44:14,985
How can you not drink soju with spicy stir-fried chicken? That's the unwritten law.

580
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,155
- I still don't-
- Still,

581
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:21,555
you should abide by the unwritten law since it's still a law.

582
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,375
I'll just have a glass of beer, then.

583
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:29,125
Excuse me! Please give us a bottle of beer

584
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,345
in addition to the soju.

585
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:41,735
Beer tastes smoother when mixed.

586
00:44:41,735 --> 00:44:46,125
I know the killer ratio for somaek*. Should I show you one?
(Soju and beer.)

587
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,555
I'm fine.

588
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:50,645
I get drunk too quickly when I drink soju.

589
00:44:55,565 --> 00:44:56,695
I'll take this call.

590
00:44:56,695 --> 00:44:59,845
Oh, okay! You can go ahead. Hurry!

591
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,635
<i>Get him totally plastered.</i>

592
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:08,285
So he won't even realize if it's a dream or not

593
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:10,765
when a dog he just kissed becomes human.

594
00:45:10,765 --> 00:45:12,555
You got it?

595
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:16,705
Even that bastard who said he loved me thousands of times

596
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:20,685
treated me like a monster when I became a dog in front of his eyes.

597
00:45:20,685 --> 00:45:25,025
Worse off, you've got an awkward and uncomfortable coworker.

598
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:27,925
Make sure no one catches you.

599
00:45:35,195 --> 00:45:36,755
More, more, more.

600
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:39,585
More!

601
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:52,345
Cheers.

602
00:45:52,345 --> 00:45:54,265
Sure.

603
00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:28,955
I'm getting so drunk.

604
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:44,725
Gosh, why are we leaving this early when she turns at midnight?

605
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:46,625
You have nothing to do anyway.

606
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:49,295
Get a girlfriend or something if you don't want to do this.

607
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:53,855
Y-You think I can't get a girlfriend, huh?

608
00:47:01,315 --> 00:47:03,385
Well...

609
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:08,435
I kind of know why you insisted on wanting to see me tonight.

610
00:47:09,315 --> 00:47:10,985
Sorry?

611
00:47:10,985 --> 00:47:14,125
Since I'm close to Bo Gyeom,

612
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,365
you want me to connect you both, isn't it?

613
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:20,575
Oh, you're right. That's right. The connection.

614
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:26,695
But I don't know if I could help you because I'm very clumsy at this.

615
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:29,675
Come on, what's there to be clumsy about?

616
00:47:29,675 --> 00:47:32,335
You just need to be there in that place.

617
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:34,555
If you'll just stay there in your spot,

618
00:47:34,555 --> 00:47:38,755
I won't think twice and go to him with your help.

619
00:47:45,515 --> 00:47:47,295
By the way...

620
00:47:48,675 --> 00:47:50,795
why do you hate me, Mr. Jin?

621
00:47:50,795 --> 00:47:52,315
Why would I hate you, Ms. Han?

622
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:54,425
Exactly! Why do you hate me?

623
00:47:54,425 --> 00:47:56,985
What did I ever do to you?

624
00:47:56,985 --> 00:47:58,335
But I never hated you.

625
00:47:58,335 --> 00:48:00,645
Whoa! You make me laugh.

626
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:05,155
I've got an upset note in my heart, okay? I remember everything.

627
00:48:05,155 --> 00:48:07,515
<i>During fifth period's free period on April 20th, last year,</i>

628
00:48:07,515 --> 00:48:10,765
<i>when the teachers chipped in to buy snacks.</i>

629
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:13,175
Whoa, gosh.

630
00:48:13,175 --> 00:48:15,815
We didn't buy soondae.

631
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:21,535
Whoa, you disappeared in a split second.

632
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:23,445
Did you use an invisible cape or something?

633
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:26,055
Do you remember or not?

634
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:26,935
I remember.

635
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:29,425
And also, on Ms. Song's birthday last year,

636
00:48:29,425 --> 00:48:31,885
<i>when we went to buy the cake together.</i>

637
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:34,195
They say the mango flavor tastes good,

638
00:48:34,195 --> 00:48:37,645
but Ms. Song likes matcha flavor.

639
00:48:41,355 --> 00:48:44,255
But that one looks tasty, too.

640
00:48:46,695 --> 00:48:48,605
What should we do?

641
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:50,845
Do you remember or not?

642
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:56,045
I remember.

643
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:57,575
See?

644
00:48:57,575 --> 00:48:59,135
I mean,

645
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:01,775
why on Earth do you hate me?

646
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:04,245
Why do you find me uncomfortable?

647
00:49:04,245 --> 00:49:07,015
When I'm with you, it's really-

648
00:49:10,445 --> 00:49:11,995
I have my reasons.

649
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:15,005
So, tell me about those reasons.

650
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:28,495
Anyhow, it's true I avoided you because I was a bit uncomfortable,

651
00:49:28,495 --> 00:49:31,205
but it wasn't because I hate you.

652
00:49:31,205 --> 00:49:33,415
I'm sorry if I made you misunderstand.

653
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:35,515
